Explain the importance of Namenode in Hadoop cluster
Ans:
1.As seen earlier HDFS is the key and vital component of Hadoop as a system.
2.Namenode comes into picture when the question arises of storing the metadata of HDFS.
3.Namenode is the master node or the primary node for controlling the storage of data.
4.It is the centerpiece of HDFS.
5.Unlike commodity machines,Namenode is a high end system with a lot of RAM.
6.Namenode is a critical component for HDFS such that when it goes down,
Hadoop cluster is unaccessible.
7.Therefor in Hadoop 2.x we have High availability to take care of it's crash and always at standby.
8.NameNode only stores the metadata of HDFS â€“ the directory tree of all files in the file system,
and tracks the files across the cluster.
9.NameNode does not store the actual data or the dataset. The data itself is actually stored in the DataNodes.
10.NameNode knows the list of the blocks and its location for any given file in HDFS. With this information 
NameNode knows how to construct the file from blocks.
